# LoL Team Builder

This project is a small app to build and save league teams, designed by Alban Spindler for a tech test.

## Installation Guide

Donwload the project and then run:

### `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

There's some problem with the depedencies as the library "react beautiful dnd" didn't update to React 18, but it still works fine :)

### `npm start`

You can then launch the app locally with this command !

### `Admin Admin`

This is the username and password to get through the login page. Please don't tell anyone, this is obviously really really well secured...

## `How to use`

Simply drag and drop champions into the role you want it to be. You can change the title of the team and add it to your list of teams. 
This is only runtime saved.
